Welcome to Monsters API - a short list of silly pranksters that loves to mess with code and programmers. Let's meet all of them face to face! ðŸ’ª

## API

By default API works on `localhost:8080/api/v1`. There's no [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) restrictions ðŸ‘Œ. Just make sure your `node.js` version is `>=8.9.4`.

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1
{
  "data":{
    "message": "Hello, Monsters API! ðŸ‘‹"
  }
}

$ curl -I http://localhost:8080/api/v1
# ...
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
# ...
```

## End points

* `GET /monsters`

Returns array of monsters with their names and slugs. Slug is used for requesting monster details.

```bash
{
  "data":[
    {
      "name": "Fooz",
      "slug": "fooz",
      "images": {
        # ...
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Bazz",
      "slug": "bazz",
      "images": {
        # ...
      }
    },
    # ...
  ]
}
```

* `GET /monster/:slug`

  If slug is correct and monster exists, will response with generated monster details. Each server instance will create new statistics so don't be surprised with the diffs ðŸ˜‰. Those monsters... they're so unpredictable!


```bash
{
  "data": {
    "name": "Fooz",
    "statistics": {
      # ...
    },
    "description": "Lorem ipsum...",
    "images": {
      # ...
    }
  }
}
```
